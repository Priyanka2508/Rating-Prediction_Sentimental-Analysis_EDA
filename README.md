# Rating-Prediction_Sentimental-Analysis_EDA

The following repository entails 3 projects as mentioned below:
1. Guvi Rating Prediction
2. Instagram Exploratory Anlaysis
3. Twitter Sentimental Analysis

# Guvi Rating Prediction:
This model preficts the rating of each course across categories. 
1. Load the data
2. EDA- Check datatype, unique values in categroical features,correaltion, distribution of data, skewness, outliers.
3. Model Building and Assesment: Decision tree regressor,XGB Regressor,XGB Random Forest Regressor,Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boost Regressor
   
# Instagram EDA:
This project focuses on EDA in the following analysis:
1. Are there any correlated features in the given dataset? If yes, state the correlation
coefficient of the pair of features which are highly correlated.
2. What is the frequency distribution of the following features?
○ Influence Score

count of Instagram influencers in different countries using barchart.
4. Who are the top 10 influencers in the given dataset based on the following features
